# Web-Scraping-and-Visualization
**Visualizing COVID-19 Impact across the World**


The coronavirus COVID-19 is a worldwide pandemic that has spread quickly across the world in just a few months. In this notebook, I used webscraping to extract out data on COVID-19 from Worldometers, a website which provides the latest update on the statistics of COVID-19. After cleaning the extracted data, I created visualizations to better understand the impact of COVID-19 across the world.


**Modules and libraries used:**

For Web-scraping:
* BeautifulSoup

For Analysis and Visualizations:
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
